		SimpleCV is a Python interface to several powerful open source computer vision libraries in a single 
		convenient package. With it, your software can have access to high level algorithms in feature 
		detection, filtering, and pattern recognition in a unified framework. Forget about bit depths, file 
		formats, color spaces, buffer management, eigenvalues, and matrix vs bitmap storage.
