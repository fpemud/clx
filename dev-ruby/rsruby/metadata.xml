<longdescription>
RSRuby is a bridge library for Ruby giving Ruby developers access to the full R statistical programming environment. RSRuby embeds a full R interpreter inside the running Ruby script, allowing R methods to be called and data passed between the Ruby script and the R interpreter. Most data conversion is handled automatically, but user-definable conversion routines can also be written to handle any R or Ruby class.
