		This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the Faye project. It provides classes for easily building WebSocket servers and clients in Ruby. It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing Rack application. It does not provide any abstraction other than the standard WebSocket API.
