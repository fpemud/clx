		RMMSeg is an implementation of MMSEG Chinese word segmentation algorithm. It is based on two variants of maximum matching algorithms. Two algorithms are available for using: * simple algorithm that uses only forward maximum matching. * complex algorithm that uses three-word chunk maximum matching and 3 additonal rules to solve ambiguities. For more information about the algorithm, please refer to the following essays: * http://technology.chtsai.org/mmseg/ * http://pluskid.lifegoo.com/?p=261
