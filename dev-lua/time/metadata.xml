		Time

		This is a MIT licensed library for the manipulation of dates and periods according to the Gregorian calendar, i.e. the internationally accepted calendar for most uses. The library is built around two concepts:

		date: a specific point in time, for example yesterday at 3:00 PM
		period: a duration of time, for example three hours

		with the following characteristics:

		dates and periods have microsecond (1-millionth of a second) precision
		leap years are taken into account
		all years have the same number of seconds, i.e. there are no leap seconds
