		lthread is a multicore/multithread coroutine library written in C. It uses Sam Rushing's _swap function to swap lthreads. What's special about lthread is that it allows you to make blocking calls and expensive computations, blocking IO inside a coroutine, providing you with the advantages of coroutines and pthreads. See the http server example below.
