AdWords API Perl Client Library
===============================

Google's AdWords API service lets developers design computer programs that
interact directly with the AdWords platform. With these applications,
advertisers and third parties can more efficiently--and creatively--manage
their large or complex AdWords accounts and campaigns.

The AdWords API Perl Client Library makes it easier to write Perl clients to
programmatically access AdWords accounts. One of the main features of this
client library is that it hides SOAP layer from end user, which makes it
much more easier to interact with API. The outgoing and incoming SOAP messages
can be monitored and logged on demand.

The backbone of the client library is a modified version of SOAP::WSDL. It
handles the serialization/deserialization, transport, and creating classes
for the objects defined in the AdWords API WSDLs. SOAP::WSDL, in turn, uses
SOAP::Lite under the hood for some operations.

The AdWords API Perl Client Library currently supports v200906 and a subset of
v200909 of the AdWords API, and can be used in the Production or Sandbox
environments. Only the core campaign management ('cm') services are currently
supported for v200909. If you need to make use of functionality found in v13 of
the AdWords API, such as the ReportService, you can make use of a legacy library
developed by Rohan Almeida. It is available from CPAN at

  http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Google::Adwords

Demo scripts, located in "example/", demonstrate some examples of using client
library. For additional examples, take a look at unit tests in "t/".

Documentation is provided in POD format inline in each of the modules. HTML
versions of the POD are also available in the 'docs/' directory.

The client library includes a set of unit tests located in "t/". All unit tests
are (and should be) executed against Sandbox environment. Whenever changes
are made to the client library, the appropriate unit test should be executed to
make sure that everything is working as intended and no new bugs were
introduced.


Step-by-step guide for getting started:
---------------------------------------

1) Make sure you have Perl 5.6 or later installed. More information on Perl can
   be found at http://www.perl.org/

2) From this directory, run

     perl Build.PL

   to generate your Build file. This relies on having Module::Build installed.

3) The client library has a number of dependencies which are defined in the
   Build.PL script. If you are missing any modules, you'll receive a warning in
   step 2. You can install any dependencies using CPAN, either manually from the
   web (http://www.cpan.org/) or automatically using the CPAN shell
   (http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN-1.9304/lib/CPAN.pm).

4) This client library relies on a development version of the SOAP::WSDL module,
   and also relies on patches to that module. You download the version of
   SOAP::WSDL available at
   http://soap-wsdl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/soap-wsdl/SOAP-WSDL/branches/Typemap.tar.gz?view=tar&pathrev=846
   and expand the gzip and tar archive. Once that's done, run the
   soap_wsdl_patches.pl script on the expanded Typemap directory like so:

     bin/soap_wsdl_patches.pl /path/to/downloaded/Typemap

5) Install the patched SOAP::WSDL following the directions in its README.

6) Install this module, making use of the Build script generated in step 2:

     perl Build
     perl Build test
     (sudo) perl Build install

7) Sign up for a Google Account, if you don't already have one, at
   https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount

8) Copy the sample 'adwords.properties' file to your home directory, and edit it
   to reflect the credentials for your Google Account.

9) Try running the sample code in the 'examples' directory.

10) Read over the documentation in 'docs/' to familiarize yourself with
    the various classes and methods in the client library.


Where do I submit bug reports and/or feature requests?
---------------------------------------------------

External Dependencies:
----------------------

Full dependency list is maintained in Build.PL. This module also depends on a
patched development version of SOAP::WSDL. Please see step 4 of the getting
started guide above for more details.
