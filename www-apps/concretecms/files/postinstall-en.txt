To setup your instance of Concrete CMS you have to do the following:

1) Setup a MySQL database for Concrete CMS, e.g. on the commmand line:
   
   mysql -u root -p

   At the MySQL prompt execute the following commands:
   
   CREATE DATABASE concretecms;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON concretecms.* TO 'concrete'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED
   BY 'thisshouldbeasecurepassword';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

2) Point your browser to

   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}

   and follow the instructions of the web installer.

3) If you have installed danish (da), german (de), french (fr), brazilian
   (pt_BR) or swedish (sv) localisation files, include one of the following
   in the newly created config file in
   ${VHOST_ROOT}/${VHOST_APPDIR}

   define('LOCALE', 'xx_XX')

   where xx_XX is one of da_DK, de_DE, fr_FR, pt_BR or sv_SE
