		This project is a fork of Pavel Kobyakov's excellent flymake.el to let me play around with some updates before contributing them upstream.

		Features added so far:

		Support for queuing up syntax checks once a certain number are in-progress.
		Support for placing temporary files in the system temporary directory.
		Spawns only one buffer-modification timer check rather than one per buffer.
		Show multiple errors in tooltips.
		Improved support for remote files over Tramp.
		Improved error message classification. (err/warn/info, customizable regexp)
		Support for new languages: Javascript and CSS.
		Minor other bug fixes.
