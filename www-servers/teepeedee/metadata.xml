		teepeedee is a small, hopefully scalable, single-threaded file server. It can serve or receive multiple files over http, https and ftp simultaneously, listening on any number of ports and providing entirely different views of the filesystem to different users. It uses sendfile and is written in C++.

		It supports most of the draft-ietf-ftpext-mlst-16.txt FTP extensions, EPRT, EPSV, AUTH TLS, and does HTTP 1.1 persistant connections, and HTTPS.
