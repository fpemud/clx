		Trusted Boot (tboot) is an open source, pre-kernel/VMM module that uses
		Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology (Intel(R) TXT) to perform a measured
		and verified launch of an OS kernel/VMM.

		This version of tboot supports Intel (both retail and Software Development
		Platforms (SDPs)) and OEM systems that are Intel TXT-capable.

		This version of tboot only supports both the Xen virtual machine monitor
		(versions >= 3.4) and Linux kernel versions >= 2.6.33.
