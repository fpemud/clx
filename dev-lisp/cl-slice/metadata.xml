		This library provides the following:

		A user interface for taking slices (elements selected by the Cartesian product of vectors of subscripts for each axis) of array-like objects. The most important function is slice. Unless you want to define a method for this (besides what is already implemented), this is pretty much all you need from this library. See the next section for a tutorial.
		An extensible DSL for selecting a subset of valid subscripts. This is useful if, for example, you want to resolve column names in a data frame in your implementation of slice.
		A set of utility functions for traversing slices in array-like objects.
