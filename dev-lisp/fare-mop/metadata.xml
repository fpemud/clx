		fare-mop is a small collection of utilities using the MOP.
   6 It notably contains a method SIMPLE-PRINT-OBJECT, and
   7 a mixin SIMPLE-PRINT-OBJECT-MIXIN that allow you to trivially define
   8 PRINT-OBJECT methods that print the interesting slots in your objects,
   9 which is great for REPL interaction and debugging.
