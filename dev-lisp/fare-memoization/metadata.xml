		This library builds on an age-old idea: dynamically memoizing Lisp functions.
		A memoized function remembers results from previous computations, and
		returns cached results when called with the same arguments again,
		rather than re-do the computation. This library allows you
		to focus on the computation logic and handles the caching part for you.
		It also allows you to memoize a function after the fact when you need it.
		Obviously, you should only use memoization for functions where it is meaningful:
		pure functions that are expensive to compute,
		non-deterministic functions for which it matters that choices be consistent,
		hash-consing constructors that need return the same result when called with
		the same arguments, user-visible constructors for singleton classes, etc.
