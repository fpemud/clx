		This CL library allows you to spawn local or remote processes and shell pipes.
		It lets me use CL in many cases where I would previously write shell scripts.
		The name is a pun, in that this library can both
		let you spawn inferior (children processes) shells, and
		serve itself as an inferior (not so featureful) shell.
		Because so many features of a shell are missing,
		inferior-shell only brings down the low-hanging fruits of shell scripting;
		yet CL is such a better programming language than the shell
		(or other "scripting" languages) that it is already a great pleasure
		to be able to write things in CL rather than in these languages.
		More features will come, and/or you can use other CL libraries as a complement.

		Inferior-shell recognizes a small domain-specific language to describe
		commands or pipelines of commands, and some functions to actually run
		these pipelines either locally or remotely (via ssh).
		It will implicitly invoke ssh when asked to run a command on a remote host;
		for best results, be sure to have passphrase-less access to these hosts
		via e.g. ssh-agent.
