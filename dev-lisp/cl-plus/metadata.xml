		CL+ is an Interface on Common Lisp for Rapid Prototyping. The goal of this project is not to create a new lisp dialect, nor to become a new utility collection. Instead, the goal of CL+ is a modern interface on CL for making inefficient ver.1 program, quickly. Removing CL+ layer on CL, we are able to optimize inefficient ver.1 program to efficient ver.2 program.
