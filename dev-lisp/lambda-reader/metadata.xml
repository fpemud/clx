		LAMBDA-READER is a library that lets you use unicode character Î» for LAMBDA in reader and printer. It was written by Fare Rideau based on an original idea by Brian Mastenbrook.

		It depends on named-readtables for managing the readtable. Maybe in the future that should be replaced by cl-syntax.
