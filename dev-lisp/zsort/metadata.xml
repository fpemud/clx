		zsort is a collection of portable sorting algorithms. Common lisp provides the sort and stable-sort functions but these can have different algorithms implemented according to each implementation. Also, the standard sorting function might not be the best for a certain situation. This library aims to provide developers more options. Although for most situations the standard functions are more than enough, zsort could be a useful complement.
