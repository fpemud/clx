		CL-feed-parser is a feed parser library for Common Lisp. The function parse-feed takes a url, pathname, string or stream as an argument, and returns hash-table stored feed data. The goal of cl-feed-parser is to treat the feed as the one format by hiding the difference of various feed formats (atom1.0, rss1.0, rss2.0, etc.).

		This project is inspired by python feedparser (a.k.a. Universal Feed Parser). The feedparser is created by Mark Pilgrim, and bringing up by Kurt McKee.

		Though cl-feed-parser's implementation is different from feedparser's, api is almost the same.
