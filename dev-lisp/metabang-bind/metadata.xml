		Bind combines let, destructuring-bind and multiple-value-bind and a whole lot more into a single form. It has two goals:

		reduce the number of nesting levels

		make it easier to understand all of the different forms of destructuring and variable binding by unifying the multiple forms of syntax and reducing special cases.
