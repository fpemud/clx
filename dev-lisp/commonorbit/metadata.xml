		CommonORBIT (also called CORBIT) is an object-oriented extension of Common Lisp. It uses a prototype (classless) model of OOP, is easy to use and yet has many sophisticated features found also in KL-ONE type languages. CommonORBIT is a Common Lisp reimplementation of ORBIT, which was originally conceived by Luc Steels around 1981-1983. Because of its delegation-based rather than class-based inheritance, CommonORBIT offers extreme flexibility to define and change practically anything at run-time. Because of the generic functions, it fits well into regular Lisp code. It can co-exist with CLOS but remains completely separate.
		BOOPS (Beginner's Object-Oriented Programming System) is a stripped-down version of CORBIT. It is very small, efficient and simple and intended for classroom use.
