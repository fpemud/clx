		libsodium bindings for Common Lisp

		This is a wrapper of the the libsodium library as well as a very thin layer of abstraction to make things a bit more lispy than running raw C functions.

		The goal of this project is to provide easy, correct, safe crypto for common lisp. It relies entirely on libsodium for all cryptographic tasks.
