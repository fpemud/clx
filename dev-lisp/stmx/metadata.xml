		STMX is a high-performance implementation of composable Transactional Memory (TM) for Common Lisp. TM is a concurrency control mechanism aimed at making concurrent programming easier to write and understand. Instead of traditional lock-based programming, one programs with atomic memory transactions, which can be composed together to make larger atomic memory transactions.
