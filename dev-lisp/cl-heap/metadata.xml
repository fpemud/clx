		CL-HEAP is a Common Lisp library that provides efficient priority queue and heap implementations. Heaps are tree data structure in which any child, c, of a parent, p, obeys the relation p R c, for some relation R (often less-than or greater-than). Heaps can be used directly as priority queues, and are important components of many algorithms, like those for finding shortest paths and calculating minimum spanning trees.
