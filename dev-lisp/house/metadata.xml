		:house
		Minimal asynchronous Common Lisp web server

		:house started out as part of the :deal project ("deal"? "house"? get it?). I hacked it out in an attempt to generalize it and use it other projects with similar objectives. It's intentionally minimal, single-threaded and stresses readability over efficiency both in its internals and in the interfacing code it requires.
