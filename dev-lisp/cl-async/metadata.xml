Cl-async is a library for general purpose, non-blocking programming in Common Lisp. Cl-async uses Libevent2 as the backend, which is a fast, stable, portable library for asynchronous IO (see my notes on choosing Libevent).

The main goal is to provide an experience that makes general asynchronous programming in lisp natural, and to also provide a number of drivers on top of cl-async.

This library's current status is BETA. You will generally have a better experience by using the git version of this library and the git version of the libevent2 bindings.
