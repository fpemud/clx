		A standalone promise implementation for Common Lisp. This is the successor to the now-deprecated cl-async-future project.

		Its goal is to provide an abstraction around synchronous and asynchronous code in a way that's natural to regular lisp programming. This is ideal for both writing drivers that can handle both blocking and non-blocking sockets, as well as various threading operations that have the concept of a delayed result.
