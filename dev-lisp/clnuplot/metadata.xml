		CLNUPlot lets you manipulate plots in Lisp and then write out a command file that can executed in GNUPlot. The basic model is one of plots and data-sets. A plot contains information for the entire information display; for example, the title, the axis labels and so forth. Each data set contains information about how to display a single group of data in some format; e.g., the data, the display style, the name of the data in the legend and so forth. A plot contains one or data sets.
