		This is a simple linear algebra math library in Common-Lisp.
		It contains datatypes for 2 and 3 dimensions.

		It provides some simple algorithms commonly used for computer
		graphics, like rotation, transformation, scaling and interpolation
		of vectors. It also provides functions to convert between different
		representations of rotations, namely matrices, quaternions, euler
		angles (yaw, pitch, roll) and axis/angle.
