		Xelf extends Common Lisp with an Emacs-inspired 2D OpenGL game engine, a game project editor interface, and an integrated command shell. Along with a Common Lisp compiler such as Steel Bank Common Lisp, Xelf can be used to write games that compile from a single codebase into optimized native executables for Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux. Xelf also supports live integration with GNU Emacs via SLIME or SLIMV.
