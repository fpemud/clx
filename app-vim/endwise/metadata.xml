		This is a simple plugin that helps to end certain structures automatically. In Ruby, this means adding end after if, do, def and several other keywords. In Vimscript, this amounts to appropriately adding endfunction, endif, etc. There's also Bourne shell, VB (don't ask), C/C++ preprocessor, and Lua support
